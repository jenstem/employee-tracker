## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create an Employee Tracker that would help a user to keep track of details regarding their employees' positions.  The Employee Tracker would store necessary information and allow the user to view or make updates to that information.

The user would be able to view all departments, roles and employees.  The user would also be able to add a department, role or employee and make updates to an employee's role.  Allowing the user to quickly and easily a keep track of details regarding their employees' positions.
